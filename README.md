# reactjs-boilerplate

Boilerplate for creating React Apps which do not have any SEO / SSR requirements.

## Setup React Project

We can use this boilerplate to create new react applications. We don't have to worry about setting up things from scratch.
Like installing advance libraries, packages and tools for development, testing, debugging and deployment.
All the things are available in this boilerplate. So let's start building the beautiful React applications.

> Note: We use yarn as default package manager for this repository.

### Quick Start
- Make sure that you have node.js and yarn installed.
- Clone this repo using `git clone git@gitlab.com:development-team20/boilerplates/reactjs-boilerplate.git`.
- Create a new project on gitlab.
- Set remote url of this cloned project to the newly created project on gitlab using 
`git remote set-url origin <new.git.url/here>`
- Change root folder name `reactjs-boilerplate` to your <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>.
- In `package.json`, change name `reactjs-boilerplate` to your <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>.
- Create `.env` file according to [.env.template](./.env.template).
- Install all dependencies using `yarn install`.

### Development Build
- `yarn start`
### Production Build
- `yarn build`
### Run on Docker
- #### Development
  - `yarn docker-dev`
  - Run the container: docker run -p 3000:3000 app-dev:latest

- #### Production
  - `yarn docker-prod`
  - Run the container: docker run -p 8080:80 app-prod:latest
## Sentry Integration

[Sentry](https://sentry.io/) is a self-hosted and cloud-based application monitoring that helps software teams see clearer, solve quicker, & learn continuously. We will integrate it to report unhandled exceptions.

- Create an account on [Sentry](https://sentry.io/)
- Sentry provides various options to create a new project, create a React project 
- After creation, you would be navigated to setup page. There you can find your dsn key tobe used in configuration
- Dependencies for sentry `(@sentry/react @sentry/tracing)` are already added in the boilerplate
- Save your dsn key from sentry as `REACT_APP_SENTRY_DSN` in `.env` file
- Initialize Sentry as early as possible in your app, preferably in root file (`index.ts` or `app.ts`) 
``` 
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";
import { BrowserTracing } from "@sentry/tracing";
import App from "./App";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: process.env.REACT_APP_SENTRY_DSN, # this is your dsn key from sentry project
  integrations: [new BrowserTracing()],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```
- After configuration try creating any error in your app e.g
```
<button onClick={methodDoesNotExist}>Break the world</button>;
```
#### This error would be reported in your sentry project under issues

## RBAC (Role Base Access Control)

Followings are the details about how RBAC is implemented in routes

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

- Base file for routing is ```src/routes/index.tsx```
- Routes are divided in 2 modules ```private-routes.tsx``` & ```public-routes.tsx``` respectively
- ```src/constants/roles.ts``` contains enums for multiple user roles
-  ```src/routes/private-route-config.ts``` is config for all the permission based routing 
- ```src/routes/map-allowed-routes.tsx``` is where we map only allowed routes for a specific user to render
